    <br><h1>Breaki Moblie  APP</h1></br>
    <p>Breaki app helps to come up with travel itineraries. 
        Through this app, users can organize their trip more effective 
        and create a way that they can travel in their
         study and working time.</p> 
  </div>

  <div class="challenge">
    <br><h1>challenge</h1></br>
    <p>To create a modern-day mobile app that helps people plan their next trip, 
        post-pandemic and travel safe.</p>
        <br><h1>Problem </h1><br>
        <p>Young Travelers are finding it hard to plan their trips while 
            studying and working full time. As  much information on the internet about places to travel, but because of the difficulty of preparing travel for the first time, it can be highly stressful for novice traveless
            to plan ahead.</p>
 <br><h1>Project Goals</h1></br>
 <ul>
    <li>Easy to navigate through the app</li>
    <li>Shows the right place to vists</li>
    <li>Time conusiming</li>
  </ul>
     </div>

     <div class="Research">
        <br><h1>Research</h1></br>
        <br><p>  To understand the problem,I first with create a
            proto persona and which led me to interview 6
             user that have had experiencing in traveling or 
            wanted to travel but because COVID couldn’t
            travel. To understand the user experience when they are traveling,
             i wanted focus my question on how they make their travel 
             decision and what kind of step they take to organize their 
             travel and when they feel is right time for them to travel.</p><br>

               <br><h2>Affinity Map</h2></div></br>
               <p>After conducting the user interview, i  got all my notes from the interview
                divide  into the section which thought had same answer were common
                between user. which helped me to develop the potential user that want 
                i to create traveling app, which also led to find the right persona for my app. </p>

            <Div class="User persona">
              <br><h2> User Persona</h2><br>
              <p>
                Doing all the  6 interview and creating affinity maps, which helped to find the 
                users that i want to focus this app on, initially i want this app to be for older user
                but when i did my interview and i came to realize all user were from the age 18 
                to 30, which made realize that i wanted my user to young adults and they 
                all had something in common which was they all student wanting to travel 
                but not kind right travel and didn’t how to plan their trips as they were always 
                working or studying.
 
so my user persona was exactly like the all the users personality.</p>

    <h1>Problem Statment</h1>

    <br><h2>Young industrious college students can feel 
        overwhelmed when trying to find the right time to
         travel whilst managing their busy schedules. 
        It is difficult for young travelers to forge suitable
         travel plans that seasonally align with their
         semester breaks.<br>How might we minimize stress for students 
        while they make decisions of when and 
        where to travel?<br></h2>

    want needs to changed in the in my final protoype.</h1>
    
    <br><h2>User Flow </h2>
    <br><p>To start creating the app, i made sure that created user flow which allowed
        to create a path on how user will navigation through the app where  will the main 
        feature add in the app. in my process of creating user flow i add the main 
        splash screen then added main feature that the user will use.</p><br>

            <br><h2>In summary, I have learned that if you focus to much on details then understanding what all steps means how they make a difference it can help to a provide better study case.
                I have also realized that I spent too much time working on the wire frames for last part of ios wire frame and ended up making them much more detailed than I should.
                <br> Next Step:
                To work on improving my interviewing skills and improving my way thinking when coming up with questions.
                Understand steps of very homework and work on my mismanagement
